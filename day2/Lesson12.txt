Lesson12 Goodbye and good luck

Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison, will sail from Portsmouth tomorrow.
We'll meet him at the harbour early in the morning.
He will be in his small boat, Topsail .
Topsai is a famous little boat.
It haas sailed across the Atlantic many times.
Capatian Alison will set out at eight o'clock, so we'll have plenty of time.
We'll see his boat and then we'll say goodbye to him.
He will be away for two months.
We are very proud of him.
He wil take part in an important race across the Alantic.
