Lesson31 Success story

Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me abouy his experiences as a young man.
Before he retired , Frank was he head of a very large business company, but as a boy he used to work ini a small shop.
It was his job torepair bicycles andat that time heused to work fourteen hours a day.
He saved money for years and in 1958 he bought a small workshop of his own .
In his tewnties Frank used to make spare parts for aeroplanes.
At that time he had two helpers .
In a few years the smal workshop had become a large factory whick employed seven hundred and twenty-eight people. 
Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early years and the long road to success.
He was still smiling when the door opened and his wife came in.
She wanted him to repair their grandson's bicycle!
