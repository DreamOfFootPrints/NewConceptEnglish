Lesson10 Not for jazz

We have an old musical instrument.
It is called a clavichord.
It was made in Germany in 1681.
Our clavichord is kept in the living room.
It has belonged to our family for a long time.
The insrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago.
Recently it was damaged by a visitor .
She tried to paly jazz on it!
She sturck the keys too hard and two strings were broken.
My father was shocked .
Now we are not allowed to touch it .
It is being repaired by a fried of my father's.
