The tempation to steal is greater than ever before---especially in large shops.
A detective recently watched a well-dressed woman who always went into a large store on Monday mornings.
One monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in, so it was easier for thedetective to watch her.

After a litle time , she chose one of the most expensive dresses inthe shop and handed it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible .
The the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying .
When she was arested, the detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter .
The girl 'gave' her mother a free dress once a week!
